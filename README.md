# Machine learning algorithms 
A collection of minimal and clean examples of machine learning algorithms implemented in numpy.

#### Why?
 This project is targeting people who wants to learn internals of ml algorithms or implement them from scratch.  

#### Implemented: 
* Deep learning (MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM)
* Linear regression, logistic regression
* Random Forests
* SVM with kernels
* K-Means
* PCA
* Factorization machines
* Gradient Boosting trees (also known as GBDT, GBRT, GBM, XGBoost)


#### TODO:
* t-SNE
* MCMC
* Word2vec
* Naive bayes 
* K-nearest neighbors


#### Contributing
Your contributions are always welcome!
