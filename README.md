# Machine learning algorithms 
Minimal and clean examples of machine learning algorithms implemented in numpy. 



Implemented: 
* Deep learning (MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM)
* Linear regression, logistic regression
* Random Forests
* SVM with kernels
* K-Means
* PCA
* Factorization machines
* Gradient Boosting (GBDT, GBRT, GBM)


TODO:
* t-SNE
* MCMC
* Word2vec
