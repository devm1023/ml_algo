# Machine learning algorithms 
A collection of minimal and clean examples of machine learning algorithms implemented in numpy.

### Why?
 This project is targeting people who wants to learn internals of ml algorithms or implement them from scratch.  

### Implemented: 
* [Deep learning (MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM)] (mla/neuralnet)
* [Linear regression, logistic regression] (mla/linear_models.py)
* [Random Forests] (mla/ensemble/random_forest.py)
* [SVM with kernels] (master/mla/svm)
* [K-Means] (mla/kmeans.py)
* [PCA] (mla/pca.py)
* [Factorization machines] (mla/fm.py)
* [Gradient Boosting trees (also known as GBDT, GBRT, GBM, XGBoost)] (mla/ensemble/gbm.py)


### TODO:
* t-SNE
* MCMC
* Word2vec
* Naive bayes 
* K-nearest neighbors
